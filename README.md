Solved following question.

1.Using the most appropriate means, implement an "isNullOrEmpty" check on the standard
String type. It should be functionally equivalent without calling any "isNullOrEmpty" built in
function. (string-utils.js)

2.Write a function that takes a single positive integer, and returns a collection / sequence (e.g.
array) of integers. The return value should contain those integers that are positive divisors of the
input integer. (positive-divisors.js)

4.Write a function that takes an array of integers, and returns an array of integers. The
return value should contain those integers which are most common in the input array.(max-occurrance.js)

5. SQL.txt with question 5

7.Write a function which combines an array of objects, grouped by a key you provide (this
key will correspond to a key found in the objects. The function will index the new object
with the value of those keys.(merge-objects.js)
